\chapter{Design Rationale}

	\section{Architecture}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hardware
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Wired video module to the phone
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Low-Latency, and therefore improving the system's responsiveness when providing feedback to user
				\end{itemize}
				\item Choice of Haptics + Sonics Feedback
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Haptics allow us to better communicate spatial information regarding their gaze and important text or a user's text of interest
					\item Sonics are natural way of communicating textual information to a user
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}


			\item Software
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Image processing before Optical Character Recognition
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Current Tesseract OCR Engine does poorly with skewed text, and therefore the image processing allows us to deskew the image as best as possible to improve performance of the OCR engine.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

	\section{Technologies Used}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tesseract Optical Character Recognition Engine version 4
			An open source OCR engine licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.\footnotemark~It is one of the most accurate open source OCR engines currently available.
			
			\footnotetext{https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Currently, the most accurate open source solution to optical character recognition
				\item Using state of the art machine learning models for word recognition
				\item Highly documented with academic papers written about itâ€™s architecture
				\item Constantly being developed by a community of developers, so if we run into problems we have a community to ask questions to
				\item Has both a C (python wrapper) and a C++ API
				\item Supported by Google
			\end{itemize}

			\item OpenCV
			An open source library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Licensed under BSD license.\footnotemark
			\footnotetext{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD\_licenses}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item De Facto standard software libraries for computer vision
				\item Lots of developer support
				\item Open source
				\item All of its data structures are compatible with Tesseract's API
			\end{itemize}
			
			\item Flask
			Flask is a lightweight Python web framework upon which PRAHVI's backend is built.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Web client framework with the smallest learning curve
				\item Fast and intuitive web API development
				\item Open Source
			\end{itemize}

			\item Nginx
			Nginx is a proxy server technology used to deploy our Flask web server and expose it via the internet.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Allows us to deploy our Flask application onto the web
				\item Seamless integration with Flask
				\item Open Source
			\end{itemize}

		\end{itemize}
