\chapter{Requirements}
The Requirements section presents a categorized and itemized list of project requirements. Categories include Functional and Non-functional Requirements and Design Constraints. Functional requirements define what must be done, while non-functional requirements define the manner in which the functional requirements need to be achieved. Both categories have sub-categories, determined by the importance of a given requirement. Design Constraints are similar to non-functional requirements but constrain the solution and not the problem.
\section{Functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Critical
	\begin{itemize}
	\item have visual sensor to detect text in users field of view
	\item communicate with the user through haptic feedback and voice dictation
    \end{itemize}
\item Recommended
	\begin{itemize}
	\item have a learning model to tag specific instances of text and symbols and improve overall recognition
	\end{itemize}
\item Specifications
	\begin{itemize}
	\item image to text translation time of 10 seconds or less
	\item recognize a field of view of 90 degrees
	\item recognize font sizes of 10pt to 50pt at a distance of about 2 feet (approximately the gazing distance between the camera
	on the users headset to a paper on a desk)
	\item image to text accuracy of 80% 
	\item able to translate normal paragraph style text articles without tabular text or images. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Critical
	\begin{itemize}
	\item easy and intuitive to recognize text in the user's environment and dictate it to the user
	\item light and untethered from a large computing system
	\item conform to the Federal Communications Commission guidelines on wearable devices\footnote{https://www.fcc.gov/general/ingestibles-wearables-and-embeddables}
    \end{itemize}
\item Recommended
	\begin{itemize}
	\item maintainable for future usage and/or upgrades
	\end{itemize}
\item Suggested
    \begin{itemize}
	\item generally aesthetically pleasing so that it does not draw too much attention from the user's surroundings
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The main device is a wearable headset whose hardware is self-contained
\item The main device's main communication with the outside world is through a smartphone
\item The main device communicates primarily through sound and touch, and not through vision
\end{itemize}
