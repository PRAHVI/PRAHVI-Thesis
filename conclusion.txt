In this project we designed and implemented a novel and cost efficient device that assists the visually impaired. 
Our device allows users to navigate text by taking a picture of an article of text that they are gazing at, translate this image to text, and finally provide a summary of the text to the user. 
Costs were kept low by working with general purpose computing hardware such as the Raspberry Pi Zero, and the ubiquitous smart mobile devices.
We primarly focused on specific domain of news articles that the software works well in. In addition, we focused on lighting scenes with have sufficient lighting , and we targeted a font range of 10 to 100 pixels.

In the future, we would like to make our system extensible to more text domains and perform more robustly in harder lightling situations.
