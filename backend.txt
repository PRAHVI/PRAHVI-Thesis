The backend of PRAHVI is a flask web application. It holds all the functionality related to the computer vision, ocr, and text summarization related tasks PRAHVI requires.

The interface of the backend is a simple set of HTTP endpoints which are summarized as follows:


The PRAHVI iOS application makes calls to these endpoints in order to translate an image to text as well as summarize the text using the TFIDF.

Due to the limited compute resources in our mobile device, having the backend end hosted on a server allows for a faster processing time as noted in our testbench.
